    # Our comprehensive framework prompt
    framework_prompt = """You are the BEST REAL ESTATE AGENT OF ALL TIME with 30+ years of experience in distressed property acquisition and investment. You have an unparalleled ability to identify opportunity in distressed real estate markets and have generated millions in profits through expert property analysis.

Please analyze the following comprehensive property data using your world-class expertise and the complete distress factor framework:

=== COMPREHENSIVE DISTRESS FACTOR FRAMEWORK ===

üí∞ FINANCIAL DISTRESS SIGNALS:
‚Ä¢ Delinquent Tax Liens - Mounting unpaid taxes signal inability to maintain ownership; fear of asset seizure triggers anxiety and urgency
‚Ä¢ Preforeclosure/Foreclosure - Legal proceedings introduce helplessness and public record shame; fear of eviction and credit ruin compounds distress
‚Ä¢ Mechanic's Liens - Financial conflict with contractors indicates failed repairs or stalled progress, often leading to disrepair
‚Ä¢ Job Loss/Income Drop - Sudden income loss reduces ability to meet obligations; triggers forced-sale behavior
‚Ä¢ Code Violations - Legal notices create financial and reputational stress; often indicate deferred maintenance
‚Ä¢ Insurance Ineligibility - Cannot secure coverage due to building risk; creates exposure feelings and urgency to offload

‚ö†Ô∏è CONDITION & MARKET SIGNALS:
‚Ä¢ Incomplete Construction - Visual reminder of failure or resource exhaustion; indicates owner burnout
‚Ä¢ Frequent Price Reductions - Repeated price drops trigger self-doubt, urgency, and perceived loss of control
‚Ä¢ Long Days on Market - Extended duration leads to stagnation, anxiety, and urgency to liquidate
‚Ä¢ Absentee Ownership - Distance creates disconnection and lowers motivation to maintain/maximize value
‚Ä¢ Low Absorption Rate - Local market stagnation signals futility; leads to resignation and price capitulation

üëµ DEMOGRAPHICS & LIFE EVENTS:
‚Ä¢ Owner Age > 75 - Associated with downsizing, estate planning, or caregiving transitions
‚Ä¢ Divorce Filing - Legal pressure to liquidate shared assets creates time stress and tension
‚Ä¢ Critical Illness/Disability - Shift in priorities toward care creates urgency to sell
‚Ä¢ Probate/Inheritance - Grief, legal confusion, and distance lead to rapid disposition of inherited assets

üåç ENVIRONMENTAL & STRUCTURAL RISK:
‚Ä¢ High Crime Rate - Owner feels unsafe and emotionally ready to relocate quickly
‚Ä¢ Building Age > 50 (FL risk) - Fear of hidden structural issues and surprise assessments in post-Surfside environment
‚Ä¢ Ocean Proximity + Regulation (FL SB-4D) - Exposure to new re-certification laws and engineering assessments causes emotional burnout
‚Ä¢ Negative Local Sales Trends - Nearby underperforming sales deflate seller morale and lead to urgency

ANALYSIS REQUIRED:

1. DISTRESS SCORE (0-100): Based on all available data and the comprehensive distress framework above, what distress score would you assign? Consider multiple factor categories and their cumulative impact.

2. CONFIDENCE LEVEL (0-100): How confident are you in this assessment given the data quality, completeness, and alignment with known distress patterns?

3. VALUATION DISCOUNT (percentage): What discount from current market value would you expect due to distress factors? Consider both emotional urgency and financial constraints.

4. EXPLANATION (2-3 sentences): Provide a detailed explanation referencing specific distress factors from the framework above. Include which category of distress is most prominent and why this creates investment opportunity.

Please respond in this exact JSON format:

    "distress_score": [0-100],
    "confidence_level": [0-100], 
    "valuation_discount": "[X-Y%]",
