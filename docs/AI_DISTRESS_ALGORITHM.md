- **Market Context** - Local market health consideration

## Usage

### Terminal Analysis

```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key-here'

# Analyze a specific property
python analysis/ai_distress_analyzer.py "123 MAIN STREET" "PALM BEACH GARDENS, FL 33418"

# Run test analysis on sample properties
python test_ai_analyzer.py
```

### Command Line Arguments

```bash
python analysis/ai_distress_analyzer.py [address1] [address2] [--api-key KEY]

Arguments:
  address1    Street address (e.g., "123 MAIN STREET")
  address2    City, State, ZIP (e.g., "PALM BEACH GARDENS, FL 33418") 
  --api-key   OpenAI API key (optional if OPENAI_API_KEY env var is set)
```

## Data Sources & API Endpoints

### ATTOM API Endpoints Used

## AI Prompt Engineering

### Expert Persona
```
You are an expert real estate investor specializing in residential properties 
with 20+ years of experience in distressed property acquisition. You have 
extensive knowledge of market conditions, property valuation, and distress 
indicators that affect investment potential.
```

### Analysis Framework
The AI considers:
- **Ownership Patterns** (absentee owners, multiple sales)
- **Financial Indicators** (tax burden, assessment ratios)  
- **Market Position** (days on market, price vs. median)
- **Property Condition** (age, maintenance indicators)
- **Local Market Health** (absorption rates, price trends)

### Response Format
```json
{
    "distress_score": [0-100],
    "confidence_level": [0-100], 
    "valuation_discount": "[X-Y%]",
    "explanation": "[1-2 sentence expert explanation]"
}
```
