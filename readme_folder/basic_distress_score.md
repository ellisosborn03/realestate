# Florida Property Distress Score â€“ Core Model (ATTOM-Only)

**Purpose:**
Compute a property distress score (0â€“100) for Florida residential real estate leads using only ATTOM APIs. All input addresses are pre-qualified as divorce-related, so no need to include a divorce flag. The model identifies financial, structural, and market-based seller distress using property-level and neighborhood-level data from ATTOM.

## âœ… Inputs

* Street address, city, state, zip

## ðŸ”Œ ATTOM API Endpoints Used

* `/attomavm/detail` â€“ estimated property value (AVM)
* `/mortgage/detail` â€“ current mortgage amount
* `/sale/snapshot` â€“ local market trends (median DOM, inventory, turnover)
* `/sale/comparable` â€“ price change history, DOM

## ðŸ“Š Distress Score Formula (Normalized 0â€“100)

| Metric                    | Weight | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV) | 25%    | Higher LTV = more financial pressure (Mortgage Ã· AVM)                     |
| DOM vs Median (DOM Index) | 15%    | Longer time-on-market signals trouble (Listing DOM Ã· Median DOM)          |
| Price Reduction Index     | 15%    | More/faster price drops = seller urgency (from comparable sales)          |
| Foreclosure Indicator     | 10%    | Presence of any pre-foreclosure/REO info                                  |
| Neighborhood Hazard Risk  | 10%    | High risk = fewer buyers, higher insurance, lower marketability           |
| Year Built Risk           | 10%    | Older buildings may face engineering/legal scrutiny in FL (e.g., >30 yrs) |
| Crime Rate Index          | 5%     | Higher crime = lower buyer demand, lower appraisal risk tolerance         |
| Income & Vacancy Factors  | 10%    | Low income + high vacancy area = market stress and fewer qualified buyers |
